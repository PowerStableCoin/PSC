            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                DAOPowerStableCoin (PSC) is a collateral-backed, decentralized stablecoin designed with integrated payment rewards, staking, and DAO governance. By locking approved collateral, PSC maintains its stability while incentivizing user engagement through bonus rewards and yield opportunities.

        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In the rapidly evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins have become essential for enabling frictionless payments and a reliable store of value. However, many stablecoins suffer from centralization or lack of user incentives. DAOPowerStableCoin addresses these issues by offering a robust, transparent, and user-incentivized stablecoin platform that integrates collateral management, bonus rewards for payments, staking, and decentralized governance.
            </p>

        <section id="problem">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional stablecoins often face one or more of the following issues:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Centralization risk and lack of transparency.</li>
                <li>No incentives for holding or transacting the token.</li>
                <li>Limited yield opportunities for users.</li>
                <li>Complexity in achieving community governance.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="solution">
            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>
                DAOPowerStableCoin presents an innovative, multi-faceted stablecoin solution that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ensures Stability:</strong> Collateral is locked to back every minted PSC token, maintaining full collateralization.</li>
                <li><strong>Incentivizes Payments:</strong> A built-in bonus mechanism rewards users with cashback when they pay registered merchants.</li>
                <li><strong>Encourages Staking:</strong> Users can stake PSC to earn additional yield, increasing token utility and reducing circulating supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Embraces Decentralized Governance:</strong> DAO-controlled parameters allow stakeholders to guide protocol upgrades and key economic variables.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="technology">
            <h2>Technology & Architecture</h2>
            <h3>Collateral Management</h3>
            <p>
                Users mint PSC by locking approved stablecoins as collateral. Unlike burning, collateral is held within the contract and is later returned during redemption.
            </p>
            <h3>Price Aggregation</h3>
            <p>
                Multiple oracle price feeds are used to calculate a median price. This robust mechanism minimizes the risk of oracle manipulation and ensures fair pricing.
            </p>
            <h3>Reentrancy & Input Validation</h3>
            <p>
                The contract employs OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard and SafeERC20 libraries, along with strict input validation, to mitigate reentrancy and front-running risks.
            </p>
            <h3>Upgradeable Design</h3>
            <p>
                Built using the UUPS upgradeable pattern, the contract can be updated securely via DAO governance while maintaining backward compatibility.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="tokenomics">
            <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
            <p>
                PSC is minted by locking collateral and redeemed to unlock it, ensuring each token is fully backed. Key aspects include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collateralization Ratio:</strong> Set and adjusted by the DAO to maintain stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Transfer Fees:</strong> A small fee on collateral transfers supports the bonus and staking reward pools.</li>
                <li><strong>Bonus Rewards:</strong> Users receive cashback rewards when paying merchants with PSC.</li>
                <li><strong>Staking Rewards:</strong> Additional yield is distributed to stakers, promoting long-term holding.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="risk-management">
            <h2>Risk Management</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oracle Dependency:</strong> Multiple oracle feeds and median calculations mitigate price manipulation risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Reentrancy Protection:</strong> All state-changing functions use nonReentrant modifiers to prevent reentrancy attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Thorough input checks ensure that addresses and amounts are valid.</li>
                <li><strong>Governance Safeguards:</strong> DAO governance and timelocks ensure responsible upgrades and parameter changes.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="roadmap">
            <h2>Roadmap</h2>
            <ol>
